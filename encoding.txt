The encoded parameters that will be sent to the scheduler 
smart contract and stored in IPFS looks like this:

```
0x00020000000000000000000000007ed1e469fcb3ee19c0366d829e291451be638e59000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000280000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000046
```

The first two bytes are the temporalUnit which must
be either `0001` or `0002` and stands for the unit which 
was used to set the parameters for this transaction. If 
the first two bytes are `0001` then the parameters
will be parsed as _block number_ otherwise if the 
first two bytes are `0002` the parameters will be parsed 
to refer to _unix epoch timestamps_ as they are recorded in 
Ethereum blocks.

Following that the rest of the bytes are simply the 
ABI encoding of the parameters that will be sent, in order.

(bytes 1 - 2   - temporalUnit)
bytes   3 -  34  -  recipient
bytes  35 -  66  -  value
bytes  67 -  98  -  callGas
bytes  99 - 130  -  gasPrice
bytes 131 - 162  -  executionWindowStart
bytes 163 - 194  -  executionWindowLength
bytes 195 - 226  -  bounty
bytes 227 - 258  -  fee 
bytes 259 - ...  -  callData
